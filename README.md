# Note-Taker

## Description
My motivation for this app was to become a more skilled developer to help me prepare for a career in the field. The reason I built this app was to showcase my skills that I've learned throughout my bootcamp experience and to also build upon those skills. This web application solves the problem of wanting to have a note taking app to write and save notes to help with daily activities or to use as reminders. While building this, I learned how to use HTML and API routes and how to use get, post, and delete requests to handle JSON data and show it in HTML files. This was also my first time using localhost and deploying an app to the web, which has taught me the usefulness of platforms such as Heroku, Microsoft Azure, and Google App Engine.

## Credits
I used a starter code for this project. The starter code is the second commit on my repo and it makes up the gitignore file and all of the public folder, besides the images folder containing the screenshot of the deployed application. The public folder contains the index.js file, the styling for the web page, and the HTML files for the two pages of the app. The creators of the starter code and the location of the starter code on GitHub can be found below:
